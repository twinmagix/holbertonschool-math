Write a function that displays the complex numbers, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void display_complex_number(complex c);
You can use printf in your code

Write a function that returns the conjugate of a given complex number.
Prototype: complex conjugate(complex c);

Write a function that returns the modulus of a given complex number.
Prototype: double modulus(complex c);
You can use the library <math.h> in your code

Write a function that returns the argument of a given complex number.
Prototype: double argument(complex c);
You can use the library <math.h> in your code
